# GitHub User Statistics Analyzer

This Python program analyzes a GitHub user's repositories to collect statistics on:
- Total additions and deletions across all repositories
- Lines of code per programming language
- Repository information (ignoring forked repositories)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- GitHub Personal Access Token

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SakuraPuare/github-stats-analyzer.git
cd github-stats-analyzer
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your GitHub Personal Access Token:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
```

### How to get a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to your GitHub account settings
2. Select "Developer settings" from the sidebar
3. Click on "Personal access tokens" and then "Tokens (classic)"
4. Click "Generate new token" and select "Generate new token (classic)"
5. Give your token a descriptive name
6. Select the following scopes: `repo`, `read:user`
7. Click "Generate token"
8. Copy the token and paste it in your `.env` file

## Usage

Run the program with a GitHub username as an argument:

```bash
python github_stats.py <github_username>
```

For example:
```bash
python github_stats.py octocat
```

## Output

The program will display:
- Total additions and deletions across all repositories
- Language statistics sorted by lines of code
- List of repositories with star count and creation date

## Notes

- The program ignores forked repositories
- GitHub API has rate limits, so analyzing users with many repositories might take time
- Lines of code are estimated based on byte count (approximation)
