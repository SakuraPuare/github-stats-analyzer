This Python program analyzes a GitHub user's repositories to collect comprehensive statistics on:
- üìà Total additions and deletions across all repositories (including forks, but only counting user's own contributions)
- üî§ Lines of code per programming language
- üìö Detailed repository information

## ‚ú® Features

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Collects detailed statistics on code contributions
- **Language Breakdown**: Shows distribution of code across programming languages
- **Smart Fork Analysis**: Analyzes all repositories including forks, but only counts user's own contributions
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently processes multiple repositories concurrently
- **Rich Output**: Beautiful console output with tables and colors
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- GitHub Personal Access Token

## üì• Installation

### Via pip (Recommended)

```bash
pip install github-stats-analyzer
```

### From Source

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SakuraPuare/github-stats-analyzer.git
cd github-stats-analyzer
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in your working directory and add your GitHub Personal Access Token:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
```

### üîë How to get a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to your GitHub account settings
2. Select "Developer settings" from the sidebar
3. Click on "Personal access tokens" and then "Tokens (classic)"
4. Click "Generate new token" and select "Generate new token (classic)"
5. Give your token a descriptive name
6. Select the following scopes: `repo`, `read:user`
7. Click "Generate token"
8. Copy the token and paste it in your `.env` file

## üöÄ Usage

### Command Line Interface

After installation, you can use the tool in three ways:

1. Using the installed command:
```bash
github-stats <github_username>
```

2. Using Python's -m flag:
```bash
python -m github_stats_analyzer <github_username>
```

3. From source:
```bash
python main.py <github_username>
```

### Command Line Options

The program supports the following command line options:

```bash
github-stats <github_username> [--debug] [--include-all]
```

- `--debug`: Enable debug output for more detailed logging
- `--include-all`: Include all languages in statistics (don't exclude any)

### Python API

You can also use the package as a library in your Python code:

```python
import asyncio
from github_stats_analyzer import GitHubStatsAnalyzer

async def analyze_user(username: str):
    analyzer = GitHubStatsAnalyzer(username)
    await analyzer.analyze()
    analyzer.print_results()

# Run the analysis
asyncio.run(analyze_user("octocat"))
```

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `main.py` | Main entry point for the application |
| `analyzer.py` | Core analysis functionality |
| `api.py` | GitHub API client |
| `cli.py` | Command line interface |
| `config.py` | Configuration settings |
| `logger.py` | Logging configuration |
| `models.py` | Data models |
| `utils.py` | Utility functions |

## üìã Output

The program will display:
- Total additions and deletions across all repositories
- Language statistics sorted by lines of code
- List of repositories with star count and creation date

## üìù Notes

- The program analyzes all repositories including forks, but only counts the user's own contributions
- GitHub API has rate limits, so analyzing users with many repositories might take time
- Lines of code are estimated based on byte count (approximation)
- Some languages are excluded by default to avoid skewing statistics (use `--include-all` to include them)
- Log files are stored in the `log` directory
